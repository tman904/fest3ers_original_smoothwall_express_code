<P>This page enables the user to enable the SSH (Secure Shell) service.
This enables remote console access to the Smoothwall machine.  For various
reasons, the SSH service listens on a non-standard port 222.</P>

<p>
  Enable or disable this service on GREEN or PURPLE using the respective
  checkboxes, and then click <b>Save</b>. This allows you finer control over
  access to the system via SSH. If neither zone is selected, the SSH daemon
  will not be started.
</p>

<P>In order to be certain that the request for an admin function is from the
Smoothwall server and not some third party web page, a referral check is
done. Enabling this feature means it is only possible to administer the
Smoothwall if the URL you visit contains either the local GREEN IP, the
local hostname, or the RED IP address. It will not be possible to administer
the Smoothwall if you connect via a DNS or Dynamic DNS name. The checkbox
labeled <STRONG>Allow admin access only from valid referral URLs</STRONG>
activates this feature.  By default it is switched off.</P>
